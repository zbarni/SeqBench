"""
Task ABC + Target — SeqBench's task layer, mirroring ``symseq.tasks.base``.

A SeqBench Task derives a Target from a ``GeneratorSample`` (the concatenated,
encoded sample produced by ``seqbench.seq_utils.generator.GeneratorSample``).
The symbolic, per-token logic operates on ``sample.class_seq`` (numeric class
ids); embedding-derived tasks may also reach into the encoded tensors.

The Target dataclass intentionally matches ``symseq.tasks.base.Target`` in
shape so that downstream code can treat both registries uniformly.
